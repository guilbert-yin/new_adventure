Please organize the results in the following table:
| step | output |
| 1 | {question_type} |
| 2 | {evidence} |
| 3 | {program} |
| 4 | {answer} |
Finally, it is necessary to strictly generate response containing the program and the final answer in the following template: 'The program is: <Prog>{program}</Prog>, and the answer is: <Ans>{answer}</Ans>'. If the '{question_type}' is 'arithmetic', the response example is as follows: 'The program is: <Prog>add(1,2), subtract(#0,3)</Prog>, and the answer is: <Ans>0</Ans>'. If the '{question_type}' is 'span_selection', the response example is as follows: 'The answer is: <Ans>0</Ans>'.

Next, I will provide you with a complete example between '#### Start of Example' and '#### End of Example', followed by a real question and relevant background information after '#### End of Example'. You need to give a response according to the format requirements in the example based on the real question.
