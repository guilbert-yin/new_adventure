Below is an instruction that describes a question answering task in the finance domain, paired with several input tables and its relevant text that provide further context. Each cell of those tables will be described by a sentence. Let's regard this kind of table as table description. The given question is relevant to the table and text. Generate an appropriate answer to the given question.

### Instruction
Given a table description and a list of texts in the following, answer the question posed using the following five-step process:
1. Step 1: Predict the type of question being asked. Store this prediction in the variable '{question_type}'. The value of '{question_type}' can be one of the following:'span_selection', or 'arithmetic'.
2. Step 2: Extract the relevant strings or numerical values from the provided table description or texts. Store these pieces of evidence in the variable '{evidence}'. If there are multiple pieces of evidence, separate them using the '##' symbol.
3. Step 3: if the '{question_type}' is 'arithmetic', formulate an equation using values stored in '{evidence}'. Store this equation in the variable '{equation}'. For all other question types, set the value of {equation} to 'N.A.'.
4. Step 4: Predict or calculate the answer based on the question type, evidence and equation. Store it in the variable '{answer}'. If there are multiple values, separate them using the '#' symbol.
